This program implements a simple trading strategy for buying and selling shares of a particular stock whose price is known to fluctuate around $100. The strategy buys 50 shares whenever the price is below the $100 threshold and sells all shares when the price is above $105. To simulate an actual market, a deduction is accounted for (for selling: 0.06% a share or at least $40, and for buying: $40 fixed).

Results obtained from over 100 trial runs illustrate that the trading strategy is effective, with an average annual profit of $64,000.

The images accompanying the source code represent the shares, profit, and cash graphs over the course of 250 days.
